# Brett D. Jameson, PhD

Every drop of seawater contains over a million microbial cells representing hundreds of species. Together, these microscopic life forms recycle essential nutrients, drive chemical transformations that regulate Earthâ€™s climate, and sustain the planetâ€™s habitability. Despite the fundamental importance of microorganisms to every ecosystem on Earth, the vast majority of microbial species and their roles as ecosystem engineers remain unknown. 

I am a microbial oceanographer studying how environmental change shapes marine microbial communities and how these shifts influence marine biogeochemical cycles. I earned my PhD in Oceanography from the University of Victoria (2023), where I investigated the microbial dynamics regulating the production and consumption of Nitrous Oxide, a potent greenhouse gas and ozone-depleting agent.

My research spans diverse marine ecosystemsâ€”from oxygen-deficient zones to mangrove sediments and coral reefsâ€”seeking to uncover the metabolic and ecological traits that drive microbial community assembly, interactions, and biogeochemical cycles. Currently, I am a Postdoctoral Scientist at the Bermuda Institute of Ocean Sciences (BIOS) and Arizona State University (ASU), where I use multi-omics approaches to understand how microbial communities facilitate thermal tolerance in reef-building corals.
